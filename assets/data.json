    "description": "I'm an astronomer at the The Center for Astrochemical Studies of the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics. Previously I was at the UK ALMA Regional Center in Manchester (UK), with an ESO ALMA COFUND fellowship and later at Institute for Astronomy of the ETH Zürich. I am interested in the star formation process, starting from large scales (molecular clouds) down to the protoplanetary disks. In particular, I focus on using the gas kinematics to understand the physical processes behind star formation. For this I also use astrochemistry as a tool to guide the planification and analysis of observations. Before moving to the UK I obtained a PhD in Astronomy from Harvard University, and before that my BSc and MSc in Astronomy from Universidad de Chile. As a PhD student, I worked as part of the COMPLETE survey with my advisor Alyssa Goodman.",

This transition is sharp, increasing the velocity dispersion by a factor of 2 in less than 0.04 pc. The existence of the transition provides a natural definition of dense core: the region with nearly constant subsonic non-thermal velocity dispersion.",

          "abstract": "We reported a wide-separation (greater than 1,000 astronomical units) quadruple system composed of a young protostar and three gravitationally bound dense gas condensations. These condensations are the result of fragmentation of dense gas filaments, and each condensation is expected to form a star on a timescale of 40,000 years. The closest pair will form a bound binary, while the quadruple stellar system itself is bound but unstable on timescales of 500,000 years (comparable to the lifetime of the embedded protostellar phase). These observations show that filament fragmentation on length scales of about 5,000 astronomical units offers a viable pathway to the formation of multiple systems.",
